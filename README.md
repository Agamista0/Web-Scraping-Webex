# Web Scraping & Webex Automation

🎓 **University Automation Project** – Built during my studies to solve a real problem:  
Managing a heavy lecture schedule on Webex while lacking time to attend everything manually.  

This project combined **web scraping, scheduling, and automation** to:  
1. Scrape and collect lecture schedules from my university portal.  
2. Store and organize them for later reference.  
3. Automatically join Webex sessions at the correct time.  
4. Ensure a proper "presence" in the lecture (joining muted with camera off).

## ⚡ Why I Built This
At university, I was facing deductions in grades for missing online attendance.  
So, instead of losing marks, I asked myself:  
*"Why not let automation take care of being in the right place at the right time?"*  

The result was a system that:  
- Saved me hours of stress.  
- Proved that automation can turn even the most annoying daily routine into something efficient.  
- Sparked my passion for becoming an **Automation & DevOps Engineer**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python** (scripting & automation)  
- **Web scraping libraries** (BeautifulSoup, Requests)  
- **Scheduling** (cron / custom script control)  
- **Webex API / Automation hooks**

## 🔑 Key Features
- Automated scraping of lecture timetables.  
- Dynamic scheduling of attendance tasks.  
- Auto-join Webex meetings with **mic & camera disabled**.  
- Modular design → separate scripts for scraping and attending.

## 😂 Fun Note
Yes… the project started as a *“survival hack”* to save my grades.  
But in the process, I ended up proving (to myself first) that **automation is powerful**.  
Sometimes, necessity really is the mother of invention.
